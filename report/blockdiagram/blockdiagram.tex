The project basically consists of five blocks or modules. These blocks will be described in following sections. To obtain I and Q, it is needed to mix sine and cosine separately to the input signal. Then I and Q will be phase 90 degrees between each other. By mixing cosine it will produces a real in-phase(I) and by mixing sine it produces an imaginary quadrature-phase(Q).
