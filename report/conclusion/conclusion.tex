I can conclude that I have designed and implemented a demodulation in VHDL. The test shows that implementation works, that the demodulator can interpret the FM signal. I have some problems about removing all clicks, but the result shows that the design can handle to remove all clicks until the SNR be less than 30 dB. The negative aspect is that the design doesn't perform very well respect to the noise. It means that the design needs some improvements to minimize the influence of noise.
